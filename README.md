# platform-gitops

**Author:** Andrew Kyle — [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-kyle-1007591/)

Configuration for every component of the platform lab, which runs on the Kubernetes
cluster built in [labs/k8s](https://github.com/andrewsgitacc/labs/tree/main/k8s).
The overall plan and build order are in
[labs/platform](https://github.com/andrewsgitacc/labs/tree/main/platform).

Git is the source of truth: components are installed from the pinned chart versions,
values and manifests in this repo. Until Argo CD arrives (Phase 3) they're installed with
`scripts/install.sh` on the utility server; after that Argo CD installs the same files.

## Layout

```
components/<name>/
  chart.yaml       Helm chart: repo, chart, pinned version, release, namespace
  values.yaml      Helm values
  manifests/       Extra resources applied after the chart (pools, issuers, gateway...)
apps/<name>/       Workloads that run on the platform (hello = Phase 2 test app)
scripts/           Bootstrap helpers, run on the utility server (dns.lab.local)
.github/workflows/ CI: render every chart and schema-check everything on each PR
```

## Components

| Component | Version | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [MetalLB](components/metallb) | chart 0.16.1 | LoadBalancer IPs 172.16.79.100–.119 on the Fusion NAT network (L2 mode) |
| [cert-manager](components/cert-manager) | v1.21.2 | Internal lab CA (`lab-ca` ClusterIssuer) and automatic certificates |
| [Envoy Gateway](components/envoy-gateway) | v1.9.1 | Kubernetes Gateway API. One gateway, `lab-gateway`, on **172.16.79.100**, HTTPS for `*.apps.lab.local` |
| [external-dns](components/external-dns) | chart 1.23.0 | Creates `<name>.apps.lab.local` records on the lab BIND server for every HTTPRoute |

How a request reaches an app:

```
https://hello.apps.lab.local
  -> DNS (external-dns record on dns.lab.local) -> 172.16.79.100
  -> MetalLB -> Envoy (lab-gateway, wildcard cert from lab-ca)
  -> HTTPRoute hello -> Service -> pods
```

To publish a new app, give it an HTTPRoute attached to `lab-gateway` (section `https`)
with a hostname under `apps.lab.local`. DNS and TLS are automatic.

## Secrets and keys

Nothing secret is stored in this repo.

- **external-dns TSIG key**: created as a Secret by `scripts/create-external-dns-secret.sh`,
  straight from `/etc/named/externaldns.key` on the utility server. Phase 4 replaces this
  with a SealedSecret.
- **Lab root CA private key**: generated inside the cluster by cert-manager and only exists
  as the Secret `cert-manager/lab-root-ca`. Only the public certificate is exported.

> **Lab only:** trusting a home-made root CA on your Mac is normal for a private lab, but
> anyone holding that CA's private key could create certificates your Mac trusts for any
> website. Keep the key in the cluster, and remove the CA from the Mac's keychain if you
> tear the lab down (see below).

## Phase 2 runbook

All commands run on the **utility server** unless marked *Mac*.

### 0. Get the repo onto the utility server

```bash
ssh admin@172.16.79.10
git clone https://github.com/andrewsgitacc/platform-gitops.git ~/platform-gitops
cd ~/platform-gitops
```

(After later changes are merged: `cd ~/platform-gitops && git pull`.)

### 1. MetalLB

```bash
./scripts/install.sh metallb
```

Test that the Mac can reach a LoadBalancer IP on the Fusion network. This uses the last
pool address, .119, so the gateway can keep .100:

```bash
kubectl create deployment lb-test --image=nginx
kubectl apply -f - <<'YAML'
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: lb-test
  annotations:
    metallb.io/loadBalancerIPs: 172.16.79.119
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector: {app: lb-test}
  ports: [{port: 80, targetPort: 80}]
YAML
kubectl get svc lb-test          # EXTERNAL-IP 172.16.79.119
```

*Mac:* `curl -s http://172.16.79.119 | head -4` shows the nginx welcome page.
Then clean up: `kubectl delete deployment,svc lb-test`

> If the curl from the Mac times out, stop here and report it: it means Fusion's NAT
> network isn't passing MetalLB's ARP replies (the same problem the k8s lab hit with
> keepalived), and Phase 2 switches to the fallback design.

### 2. cert-manager and the lab CA

```bash
./scripts/install.sh cert-manager
./scripts/export-lab-ca.sh       # trusts the CA here, writes ~/lab-root-ca.crt
```

*Mac* — trust the lab CA (asks for your Mac password):

```bash
scp admin@172.16.79.10:lab-root-ca.crt ~/Downloads/
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/Downloads/lab-root-ca.crt
```

Safari and Chrome use the macOS keychain. Firefox has its own store: enable
`security.enterprise_roots.enabled` in `about:config`, or import the cert in its settings.

To remove it later: `sudo security delete-certificate -c "Lab Root CA" /Library/Keychains/System.keychain`

### 3. Envoy Gateway

```bash
./scripts/install.sh envoy-gateway
kubectl -n envoy-gateway-system get gateway lab-gateway   # ADDRESS 172.16.79.100, PROGRAMMED True
```

### 4. external-dns

```bash
./scripts/create-external-dns-secret.sh
./scripts/install.sh external-dns
```

### 5. End-to-end test: hello app

```bash
kubectl apply -f apps/hello/hello.yaml
kubectl -n external-dns logs deploy/external-dns -f    # wait for "Adding RR: hello.apps.lab.local" then Ctrl-C
dig +short hello.apps.lab.local                        # 172.16.79.100
curl https://hello.apps.lab.local                      # JSON from podinfo, valid TLS (no -k)
```

*Mac:* open **https://hello.apps.lab.local** — the podinfo page with a padlock and
"Hello from the platform lab". (Needs `/etc/resolver/lab.local` from Phase 1.)

Check that external-dns cleans up after itself:

```bash
kubectl -n hello delete httproute hello
sleep 90; dig +short hello.apps.lab.local              # (empty)
kubectl apply -f apps/hello/hello.yaml                 # put it back
```

### Phase 2 done when

- [ ] Mac reaches a MetalLB IP (172.16.79.119 test)
- [ ] `lab-root-ca` Ready and trusted on the Mac
- [ ] `lab-gateway` Programmed on 172.16.79.100
- [ ] `hello.apps.lab.local` record created and removed automatically by external-dns
- [ ] https://hello.apps.lab.local opens in the Mac browser with a valid certificate
- [ ] `validate` GitHub Actions check green

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Look at |
|---|---|
| Service stuck `<pending>` | `kubectl -n metallb-system logs -l app.kubernetes.io/component=controller` |
| Certificate not Ready | `kubectl describe certificate -A`, `kubectl get certificaterequests -A` |
| Gateway not Programmed | `kubectl -n envoy-gateway-system describe gateway lab-gateway` |
| No DNS record | `kubectl -n external-dns logs deploy/external-dns`; on the DNS server `sudo journalctl -u named -n 50` |
| Browser certificate warning | CA not trusted on the Mac (step 2), or the page was opened by IP instead of name |
